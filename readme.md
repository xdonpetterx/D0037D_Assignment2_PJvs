#Task 8: Reflection

>What did you learn? What did you kow already?

This lab has taught me many new things such as stl functions and iterators.

>What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?

The search function in Task 6 was really tough to figure out. I was lucky enough to find a way to implement it after searching programming forums for a long time.

>How can the lab be improved?

I think that the search function in Task 6 can be clarified, but otherwise I don't have anything more to add.

>Additionally, write an estimate how many hours you spent on this lab.

Probably around 85 hours
